UPDATE : Yahoo API got shutdown, so now this won't work anymore.

Instead, I am now using ![Jaki MD](https://github.com/jakcodex) instead as a base, and I will tweak it from there.

My new updates will be on ![this repository](https://github.com/wawawawawawawa/Jaki-Muledump-Wawa-Update)



## Synopsis

This tool allows you to list contents of all your accounts in a single page (characters, their stats and items, items in vaults). Also it generates a summary of all the items - you probably saw screenshots of these in trading forum ([example](http://i755.photobucket.com/albums/xx195/Ind3sisiv3/Ilovemuledump.png)).

The point of playing the game is to have fun. Muling is not fun. I am trying to increase overall fun ratio by decreasing amount of time spent fussing with mules and storagekeeping.

## Download

All olders versions from Atomizer are [here](https://github.com/atomizer/muledump/releases).

## Howto

- unpack
- edit **`accounts_sample.js`**
- rename it to **`accounts.js`**
- open **`muledump.html`**

## Not so obvious features

- click on item to filter accounts that hold it
- click on account name for individual options menu
- ctrl-click account name to temporarily hide it from totals
- read the `accounts.js` file, it has some variables to play with
