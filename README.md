## Synopsis

This tool allows you to list contents of all your accounts in a single page (characters, their stats and items, items in vaults). Also it generates a summary of all the items - you probably saw screenshots of these in trading forum ([example](http://i755.photobucket.com/albums/xx195/Ind3sisiv3/Ilovemuledump.png)).

The point of playing the game is to have fun. Muling is not fun. I am trying to increase overall fun ratio by decreasing amount of time spent fussing with mules and storagekeeping.

## Download
